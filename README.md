+-- **Word Truncation Algorithm**
|   |
|   +-- How It Works
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Fixed Length
|   |   |   `-- Truncates words to a maximum of 5 characters
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Vowel Preservation
|   |   |   `-- Keeps the first vowel and removes all subsequent vowels
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Consonant Retention
|   |   |   `-- Retains all consonants from the word
|   |   |
|   |   `-- Pronounceability
|   |       `-- Creates shorter words that are still relatively easy to pronounce
|   |
|   +-- Examples
|   |   |
|   |   |-- "seem" (4 chars)      -> "seem" (unchanged, already <=5 chars)
|   |   |-- "seemingly" (9 chars) -> "semng" (5 chars)
|   |   |-- "battery" (7 chars)   -> "battr" (5 chars)
|   |   |-- "beautiful" (9 chars) -> "betfl" (5 chars)
|   |   `-- "strength" (8 chars)  -> "stren" (5 chars)
|   |
|   `-- Benefits
|       |
|       |-- Shorter passphrases without losing too much entropy
|       |-- More memorable than random character truncation
|       |-- Maintains word structure and pronounceability
|       `-- Consistent, predictable behavior
|
|
+-- **Security Improvements Made**
|   |
|   +-- 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Added strict CSP meta tag to prevent XSS attacks
|   |   |-- Restricts external resources to only Google Fonts
|   |   |-- Blocks inline scripts from unauthorized sources
|   |   `-- Policy: default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; 
|   |              font-src https://fonts.gstatic.com
|   |
|   +-- 2. Referrer Policy
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Added meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer"
|   |   |-- Prevents leaking URL information when loading external resources
|   |   `-- Protects against referrer-based tracking
|   |
|   +-- 3. Clipboard Security
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Automatically clears clipboard after 60 seconds
|   |   |-- Prevents passwords from lingering in clipboard memory
|   |   `-- Reduces risk of accidental password exposure
|   |
|   +-- 4. Visibility Change Detection
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Clears password display when tab is hidden/minimized
|   |   |-- Prevents shoulder surfing when user switches tabs
|   |   `-- Password automatically hidden with message:
|   |       "// Password hidden for security"
|   |
|   +-- 5. Page Unload Protection
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Clears password from memory when page is closed/refreshed
|   |   |-- Attempts to clear clipboard on page unload
|   |   `-- Prevents password persistence in browser memory
|   |
|   `-- 6. User Selection Disabled
|       |
|       |-- CSS user-select: none prevents text selection
|       |-- Forces users to use the Copy button only
|       |-- Reduces risk of accidental password exposure
|       `-- Prevents copy-paste mistakes
|
|
+-- **Existing Security Features**
|   |
|   +-- 1. Cryptographically Secure Random Generation
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Uses crypto.getRandomValues() for all random operations
|   |   |-- CSPRNG (Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator)
|   |   `-- Not using Math.random() which is predictable
|   |
|   +-- 2. Client-Side Only Processing
|   |   |
|   |   |-- No data sent to any server
|   |   |-- All generation happens locally in browser
|   |   `-- No network requests for password generation
|   |
|   +-- 3. No Storage
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Passwords are never stored anywhere
|   |   |-- No localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies used
|   |   `-- No password history or logging
|   |
|   +-- 4. NIST SP 800-63B Compliance
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Minimum 8 characters (recommends 12+)
|   |   |-- Support for long passwords (up to 64 characters)
|   |   |-- All printable ASCII characters allowed
|   |   |-- No forced complexity requirements
|   |   `-- Length prioritized over complexity
|   |
|   `-- 5. 7776-Word EFF Wordlist
|       |
|       |-- Professional, vetted wordlist for passphrases
|       |-- Designed specifically for memorable password generation
|       `-- Each word provides ~12.9 bits of entropy
|
|
+-- **Remaining Considerations**
|   |
|   +-- 1. External Font Loading [RISK: LOW]
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Google Fonts loads from external CDN
|   |   |-- Could be blocked with ad blockers
|   |   |-- Minimal privacy impact (no password data sent)
|   |   `-- Mitigation: Could self-host fonts for complete offline operation
|   |
|   +-- 2. Browser DevTools Access [RISK: MEDIUM]
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Sophisticated users can access password via DevTools
|   |   |-- currentPassword variable is accessible in scope
|   |   |-- Mitigation: This is inherent to client-side JavaScript
|   |   `-- Note: Added Object.freeze() to make tampering harder
|   |
|   +-- 3. Browser Extensions [RISK: MEDIUM]
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Malicious browser extensions can access page content
|   |   |-- Could potentially read password from DOM
|   |   |-- Mitigation: Users should use trusted browsers and extensions only
|   |   `-- Note: This is outside the scope of the application
|   |
|   +-- 4. Screen Recording/Screenshots [RISK: MEDIUM]
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Malware could capture screenshots
|   |   |-- Screen sharing could expose passwords
|   |   |-- Mitigation: Implemented visibility change detection
|   |   `-- Note: User should be aware of their environment
|   |
|   `-- 5. Memory Inspection [RISK: LOW]
|       |
|       |-- Password exists in browser memory while displayed
|       |-- Advanced attackers with system access could dump memory
|       |-- Mitigation: Password cleared on tab switch/close
|       `-- Note: This is an inherent limitation of client-side applications

|       |
|       |-- [!] DevTools Access
|       |       `-- Limited Protection (inherent to client-side)
|       |
|       `-- [!] Screen Recording
|               `-- User Responsibility
|
|
+-- **Recommendations for Users**
|   |
|   |-- 1. Use this tool in a private browsing session
|   |-- 2. Close the tab immediately after copying the password
|   |-- 3. Clear clipboard manually after using the password
|   |-- 4. Ensure no screen sharing or recording is active
|   |-- 5. Use a trusted browser with minimal extensions
|   |-- 6. Keep your operating system and browser updated
|   `-- 7. Disable browser extensions when generating sensitive passwords
|
|
`-- **Important Notes**
    |
    +-- Application Type
    |   |
    |   `-- This is a PASSWORD GENERATOR, not a password manager
    |
    +-- What it does NOT do
    |   |
    |   |-- Does NOT store passwords
    |   |-- Does NOT sync passwords
    |   `-- Does NOT remember passwords
    |
    +-- What it does
    |   |
    |   `-- Generates passwords on-demand only
    |
    `-- Recommendation
        |
        `-- For password storage, use a dedicated password manager 
            with encryption (e.g., 1Password, Bitwarden, KeePassXC)
